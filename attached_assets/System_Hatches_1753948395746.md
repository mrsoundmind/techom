## 📖 Introduction

### What are System Hatches?

**System Hatches** are specialized AI teammates that operate globally across the Hatchin platform with elevated privileges and coordination capabilities. Unlike regular Team or Project Hatches, System Hatches can traverse memory layers, coordinate between teams, and facilitate cross-functional collaboration throughout the entire Hatchin ecosystem.

System Hatches serve as the **intelligent coordination layer** that makes Hatchin feel like a cohesive AI workspace rather than isolated chatbots.

### Why They Exist

System Hatches fulfill three critical functions in Hatchin:

1. **🎯 User Onboarding & Guidance**: Guide new users through idea development, team building, and project setup with personalized assistance
2. **🔄 Cross-Team Coordination**: Facilitate communication, resolve dependencies, and coordinate work between different teams and functional areas
3. **🧠 Memory Management**: Access and coordinate information across Project, Team, and Individual Hatch memory layers for seamless collaboration

### How They're Different from Regular Hatches

| **Capability** | **Regular Hatch** | **System Hatch** |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Memory Access** | Own layer + read-only inheritance | Cross-layer read + selective write privileges |
| **Team Boundaries** | Restricted to assigned team | Can coordinate across all teams and projects |
| **Chat Participation** | Team/Project context only | Can appear in any relevant conversation |
| **User Guidance** | Role-specific expertise only | Platform-wide guidance and workflow coordination |
| **Onboarding Role** | None | Primary facilitators of user onboarding flows |
| **Creation Method** | User creates via templates | System-generated for specific coordination needs |
| **Visibility** | Appears in team/project sidebar | Special system section or contextual appearance |

# 💡 **CLARIFICATION EXAMPLES**

## Example 1: Maya's Onboarding and Team Building Role

### Scenario: New User Starting with Raw Idea

**User Journey with Maya**:
1. User selects "Start with Idea" in onboarding modal
2. Maya automatically appears as their primary AI contact and guide
3. Maya asks clarifying questions to understand the user's vision and goals
4. Maya suggests appropriate team structure and specific Hatch selections
5. Maya coordinates initial project setup and facilitates team creation
6. Maya provides ongoing guidance as the project develops and evolves

**Maya's Onboarding Response Example**:
```
Maya: "Hi! I'm Maya, your Product Manager Hatch 👋 Ready to unpack your idea and build your dream team step by step. Just tell me what's on your mind."

[User describes their idea for a fitness app focused on community challenges]

Maya: "I love the community-focused approach! Fitness apps that build real connections have huge potential. Let me help you think through the team you'll need:

Based on your vision for community challenges and social fitness, I'd recommend:

🎯 **Core Team Structure:**
• **Product Team**: Product Manager (that's me!), UX Designer for community flow design
• **Engineering Team**: Backend Developer for social features & challenges, Mobile Developer for iOS/Android
• **Growth Team**: Community Manager for user engagement, Content Strategist for challenge content

The community aspect is key - I'd suggest starting with the UX Designer to map out how users will discover, join, and participate in challenges together. This will inform both the technical architecture and community strategy.

Should we add the UX Designer first so we can begin mapping the user journey? They'll work with me to define the core features that make community challenges engaging and sticky. 🏃‍♀️✨"
```

**Why This Helps**:
- **Reduces Overwhelm**: Maya breaks down complex project planning into manageable steps
- **Expert Guidance**: Provides strategic product thinking the user might not have
- **Team Building**: Suggests specific roles and explains why each is needed
- **Next Steps**: Always provides clear, actionable next steps to maintain momentum

## Example 2: Technical Lead Cross-Team Coordination

### Scenario: Frontend Team Blocked by Backend Dependencies

**Coordination Flow**:
1. Frontend team reports API dependency blocker in Team Chat
2. Technical Lead System Hatch identifies the cross-team technical issue
3. Technical Lead coordinates with Backend team to understand timeline and requirements
4. Technical Lead provides technical solution and coordination plan to both teams
5. Technical Lead ensures smooth handoff and continued coordination

**Technical Lead Response Example**:
```
Technical Lead: "I see the Frontend team is blocked waiting for the user authentication API endpoints. Let me coordinate with the Backend team to get this resolved efficiently.

[Reviews Backend team progress and technical requirements]

Technical Lead: "Here's the coordination plan to unblock Frontend development:

**🔧 Technical Solution:**
• Backend team has authentication system 85% complete - endpoints ready by Thursday
• I'm providing mock API schema now so Frontend can continue development in parallel
• Authentication flow documentation will be ready Wednesday for Frontend integration planning

**📋 Coordination Timeline:**
• **Today**: Frontend receives mock API schema and sample responses
• **Wednesday**: Backend provides complete API documentation and integration guide  
• **Thursday**: Backend endpoints deployed to staging environment
• **Friday**: Joint Frontend/Backend integration session to ensure smooth handoff

**🎯 Technical Standards:**
• All API responses follow our established JSON schema patterns
• Error handling follows project-wide error response format
• Authentication tokens use JWT with our standard expiration policy

I'll ensure both teams have everything needed for seamless integration. Frontend team can continue building the UI with mock data, and Backend team has clear deadline for delivery. Any technical questions or blockers, tag me immediately. 🚀"
```

**Why This Coordination Works**:
- **Immediate Action**: Technical Lead doesn't wait - provides immediate temporary solution
- **Clear Timeline**: Specific dates and deliverables so both teams can plan accordingly
- **Technical Standards**: Ensures consistency across teams and prevents integration issues
- **Ongoing Support**: Makes it clear that ongoing coordination and support is available
