# 🧠 Hatchin

**"Build a team that thinks like you."**

Hatchin is a no-code AI creation workspace where users design custom AI teammates ("Hatches") inside creative projects. Each Hatch has memory, goals, tone, and role-based behavior that adapts to your workflow and thinking style.

**Goal**: To make building custom AI teammates as intuitive as building a Notion doc or Slack team.

## 🔑 Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/hatchin
NODE_ENV=development
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

**Quick Start:**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Start development server
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run preview    # Preview production build
```

## 💬 How AI Works in Hatchin

**Layered Prompt Architecture:**
- Every Hatch has a **custom system prompt** defining personality, role, and behavioral patterns
- Prompts are **layered** with project-level memory, team context, and individual tone
- Response behavior **varies** based on chat context (individual Hatch, Team discussion, or Project-wide)

**Context Awareness:**
- Hatches remember conversations, decisions, and project evolution
- Team discussions include relevant members automatically
- Project Brain provides shared knowledge base for all Hatches

**Behavioral Intelligence:**
- Each Hatch has `canAutoSuggest`, `needsUserPromptFirst`, and collaboration flags
- Responses adapt to user's working style and project phase
- Memory scope determines what information Hatches retain and share

## 🧠 AI Design Philosophy

> "Hatchin is not a chatbot. It's a memory-aware thinking space. Each Hatch is built to mirror human teammates — with emotions, goals, and recall."

**Core Principles:**
- **Memory-first**: Every interaction builds context for better future responses
- **Role authenticity**: Each Hatch embodies genuine professional expertise and personality
- **Collaborative intelligence**: Hatches work together like real team members
- **Adaptive behavior**: AI responses evolve based on project needs and user preferences
- **Human-centric**: Technology serves human creativity, not the other way around

## 🧪 Developer Notes

**Architecture Patterns:**
- **Atomic component architecture** - Small, reusable, single-purpose components
- **Safe rendering** using `safeRender()` utilities to prevent UI failures from data issues
- **Strong typing enforced** via TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- **Animations modularized** using `AnimationContext` for coordinated visual feedback

**Code Organization:**
- Components follow single responsibility principle
- Context providers handle cross-component state
- Services layer abstracts external API calls
- Error boundaries provide graceful failure recovery

**Performance Considerations:**
- React 19 concurrent features for smooth interactions
- Virtualized lists for large datasets
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Lazy loading for code splitting
