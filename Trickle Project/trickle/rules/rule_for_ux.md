When designing user interactions
- Prefer "Modals" or "Pop-ups" over full-page takeovers for quick view actions.
- Maintain user context by keeping the underlying page visible (e.g., via transparent backdrops).
- Avoid navigation that feels like "leaving the app" unless it is a definitive action.
- Use "Peek" interactions (Arc-style) for content previews, allowing users to verify relevance before navigating away.
- Ensure "Peek" modals have clear "Expand" options to promote temporary views to permanent tabs.
