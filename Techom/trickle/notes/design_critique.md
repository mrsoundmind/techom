# Design Critique & Improvement Opportunities

## 1. Brand Consistency
- **Current State**: The previous theme used Orange accents, but the new logo introduces a strong Red/Blue palette.
- **Improvement**: We need to shift the `--accent-color` from Orange to Red to match the "TechOM" branding. (Implemented in this update).

## 2. Content Depth (What's Missing)
- **Integrations Section**: For a VoIP/SaaS product, customers need to know if it connects with HubSpot, Salesforce, or Microsoft Teams. This is currently missing and is a major conversion driver for B2B.
- **Detailed Pricing Tiers**: The "Start from $1/day" is a great hook, but serious buyers need a comparison table (Basic vs Pro vs Enterprise) to understand feature gating.
- **Interactive Demo/Video**: Static images are good, but a 30-second explainer video or an interactive click-through prototype of the app interface would significantly increase time-on-page.

## 3. Trust Factors
- **Certifications**: Adding ISO compliance badges or "Made in Australia" / "Data Hosted in Sydney" badges would boost trust for local businesses worried about data sovereignty.
- **Case Studies**: Move beyond simple testimonials. Add a section for "Success Stories" with logos of real companies and specific metrics (e.g., "Saved $10k/year").

## 4. Visual Hierarchy
- **Footer**: The previous footer was too generic. A SaaS footer needs to be a "sitemap" powerhouse with App Store links, legal sub-pages, and a newsletter capture. (Addressed in this update).
- **Sticky CTA**: The mobile sticky bar is good, but on Desktop, the "Book Demo" button could benefit from a secondary style that contrasts better against the white header.

## 5. Navigation
- **Missing Pages**: Currently a single page. Breaking out "Features", "Pricing", and "About" into dedicated pages would improve SEO and allow for richer storytelling.
