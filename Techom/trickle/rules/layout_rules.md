When designing layouts:
- Ensure Bento Grids are mathematically perfect (e.g., in a 3-column grid, spans must sum to 3 per row).
- Avoid complex `auto-flow` logic that can break on intermediate breakpoints; use explicit responsive classes.
- Prioritize layout stability over complex overlapping spans.
