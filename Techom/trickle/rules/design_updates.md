When updating the design:
- AVOID abstract 3D grids or "Matrix-style" backgrounds for the Hero.
- PREFER "Human-centric" imagery generally, BUT for the Hero section, aim for "Innovative Tech Visualization" that blends human elements with cloud concepts.
- HERO SECTION: 
  - COPY STRATEGY: Clarity is King. The copy must explain "What it is" (Cloud Phone), "Why it matters" (Professionalism/Flexibility), and "How it works" (App/No Hardware) instantly. 
  - VISUALS: Keep the "High-End / Futuristic" glassmorphism.
- TRUST BAR: Needs to look premium. Use grayscale-to-color interactions or sophisticated marquees. Avoid looking like a "generic logo dump".
- SPACING: Maintain generous vertical whitespace (py-32 / 128px+) between major sections.
- VISUAL STYLE: Clean, spacious, using glassmorphism, blur effects, and refined typography.
- STRICTLY maintain a LIGHT THEME throughout.
