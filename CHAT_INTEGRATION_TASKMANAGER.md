# 💬 Chat Integration Task Manager
**Project**: Hatchin Chat System Integration  
**Created**: January 31, 2025  
**Updated**: January 31, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Moving to Phase 2

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
Integration of comprehensive chat system into existing EnhancedMultiAgentChat component with three chat modes (Project/Team/Agent), real-time WebSocket communication, and contextual UI that adapts to current selection states from ProjectSidebar.

**Chat Context Hierarchy:**
- **Project Chat**: Talk to all teams and agents under one project (shared project memory)
- **Team Chat**: Talk to all agents under a specific team (shared project memory)  
- **Agent Chat**: Talk to one specific agent (shared project memory)
- **Shared Memory**: All teams and agents under one project share the same memory and context

**Key Integration Points:**
- **EnhancedMultiAgentChat Component**: Main chat interface in center panel (UI unchanged)
- **ProjectSidebar Integration**: Chat context changes with project/team/agent selection from left panel
- **DynamicSidebar Integration**: Project brain context affects chat memory
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket for live messaging and typing indicators
- **Existing State Management**: Leverages activeProjectId, activeTeamId, activeAgentId
- **No UI Changes**: Selection happens from left sidebar, chat interface remains the same

## 🎯 Current Priority
**Next Task**: Phase 2, Task 2.1 - Chat Mode State Management

## 📊 Progress Tracking
- **Completed**: 8/18 tasks (44%)
- **In Progress**: 0/18 tasks  
- **Pending**: 10/18 tasks (56%)

## 🎛️ Integration Strategy
1. **Component Integration**: Enhance existing EnhancedMultiAgentChat instead of creating new components
2. **State Synchronization**: Leverage existing activeProjectId, activeTeamId, activeAgentId from App.tsx
3. **UI Consistency**: Keep existing chat UI unchanged, selection happens from left ProjectSidebar
4. **Incremental Enhancement**: Build on existing foundation without breaking current functionality
5. **Memory Architecture**: Shared project memory for all teams/agents under same project
6. **Context-Driven Placeholders**: Different empty state messages for project/team/agent chats

## 🔄 Decision Points
1. **Chat Modes**: 
   - Project Chat → Talk to all teams + agents under project
   - Team Chat → Talk to all agents under specific team
   - Agent Chat → Talk to specific agent (1-on-1)
2. **Context Switching**: Automatic mode changes based on ProjectSidebar selections (no chat UI changes)
3. **Memory Sharing**: All teams/agents under same project share identical memory context
4. **Database**: Use existing PostgreSQL with WebSocket infrastructure
5. **AI Integration**: Mock responses initially, integrate with project brain memory
6. **Empty States**: Context-specific placeholder text for different chat modes
